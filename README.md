# gulp-jasmine-webdriverio (work in progress)
gulp-jasmine-webdriver is a Gulp plugin to run Selenium tests with Jasmine and WebdriverIO

Much of the source code drived from the excellant gulp-webdriver by christian-bromann, only difference is jasmine as the test framework as opposed to Mocha by the later.

The orignal intention is to search for the best gulp task which supports Webdrvercss based css regression testing. The gulp-webdriver is based on Mocha test framework while our expertise based on jasmine. So, I've adopted the source code to
work with jasmine test framework.
